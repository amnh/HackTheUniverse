## American Museum of Natural History - Hack the Universe Code of Conduct

This policy has been adapted from the Space Apps NYC Code of Conduct by Mike Caprio and Alice Ng, which was based on the StartupBus Code of Conduct written by Elias Bizannes and Mitch Neff, which was in turn adopted from the Ada Initiative's guide titled <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports">"Conference anti-harassment/Responding to Reports".</a>

**About Hack the Universe @ AMNH.** AMNH is hosting its first-ever hackathon along with public programming including lightning talks and hands-on activities focused on the intersection of computer science and astrophysics. Dubbed "Hack the Universe," this is the launch event of BridgeUp: STEM, a new educational program focused on the intersection of computer science and science and is funded by a generous grant from the Helen Gurley Brown Trust. An official legal waiver will be provided upon check-in, but this document is provided as a guideline as to what we expect from the community during the event. Statements made by the AMNH organizers may supersede statements in this code of conduct wherever applicable.

**Participation at Hack the Universe @ AMNH.** You agree that your presence at the event indicates complete compliance with all rules in this code of conduct. Participants or non-participating observers violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and disallowed from participating in any future events at the discretion of the organizers. Additionally you agree that AMNH and participating sponsors and media partners will be allowed to capture your sound and image via any recording medium (audio, video, photo, any form of artwork) at the event for use in promotion and marketing with regard to their participation and your participation at the Hack the Universe @ AMNH event.

**Your Solutions at Hack the Universe @ AMNH.** The purpose of Hack the Universe is to incubate innovation amongst participants of all backgrounds who are interested in science in general and astrophysics in particular. In the spirit of scientific collaboration and for the betterment of all humanity, all projects produced at Hack the Universe @ AMNH are to be released into the public domain. There are no so-called "intellectual property" considerations at this event to be concerned with, because all work is to be made free and open to everyone in the world. Please consider attending another event if you wish to make commercially viable solutions.

You agree that any original work you create is freely available without restriction or is licensed as open source as defined by the [Open Source Initiative](http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd).

**Business Activity Restrictions at Hack the Universe @ AMNH.** As such, Hack the Universe asks that all participants and non-participating observers refrain from engaging in business related activity during the event. This event is not a forum for business, it is an opportunity to solve scientific and research problems and achieve social good for all. Please respect that. These business related activities include, but are not limited to: promotion of oneself or one's business, for example - in-person networking unrelated to working on projects, distributing printed materials or branded merchandise of any kind, or making any kind of unsanctioned announcements; pitching a business or idea that is unrelated to the challenges; any form of transactional or sales activity, whether or not money is involved. If anyone engages in any business related activities in a particularly inappropriate way, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, warning the offender or expulsion from the event and from future events. The offender will be responsible at all times for any of their own costs incurred. If you or your team are experiencing any kind of disruption due to this type of behavior, or if you have any other concerns, please contact a member of Hack the Universe staff immediately.

**Safety and Harassment Protection at Hack the Universe @ AMNH.** Hack the Universe is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks or pitches. Particularly so at Hack the Universe as it is a family event and will host underage children.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately and to not repeat their behavior.

Remember that exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you and are not appropriate for Hack the Universe.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. The participant will be responsible at all times for any of their own costs incurred. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of Hack the Universe staff immediately.

**Health and Liability at Hack the Universe @ AMNH.** Any participant who is demonstrably unwell, behaving erratically, or intoxicated will be asked to leave the event immediately for the health and safety of all participants. Venue or event security, authorities, and/or medical professionals will be called to escort any unwell person from the site. Anyone so escorted will be entirely responsible for any and all costs incurred, AMNH assumes no liability or any other consequences from such circumstances.

No alcohol or other controlled or illegal substances of any kind will be allowed on site at any time (excluding alcohol served at other event-related venues where that venue is responsible for the sale and service of food and beverages). Possession of such will result in immediate expulsion, sanctioning, and banning from future events.

**Please Contact Us Immediately Whenever You Need Assistance.** Hack the Universe staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to help them feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

If the matter is especially urgent or a local staff member is unavailable, please contact any of our organizers – all reports are confidential.
